# Todo List App

A simple to-do list app using jQuery.

Room for improvement
- Refactor data-filter with its value as argument.
- I do not think the code is optimize because I keep of re-redenring UI for every change in filter. Im not away of any other easier implementation.
- Code seems cluttered. Tried my best to separate HTML and Javascript but given the time-constraint, I dont think I can make it.
